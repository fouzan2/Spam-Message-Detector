# Spam-Message-Detector
 Here I will deploy a machine learning model using Python, HTML, and CSS. I will first train a machine learning model for the task of SMS Spam detection. The task of SMS spam detection model is to classify spam and not spam messages. To Deploy a model using Python, HTML and CSS we need 4 files, namely:  App.py: The driver code, which will consist of the code to train a machine learning model and creating a flask API. home.html: which will be a landing page where we will deploy our model. style.css: which will be used to design our landing page result.html: which will show us the result whether the message is spam or not.
